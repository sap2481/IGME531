This program runs on its own, generating both the recreation and variation of Sainte-Victoire en Rouge from a script attached to the webpage.
The primitive SVG generation components can be foun within main.js of this program, near the top of the script. These will be relocated upon completion of this project to a stored library where they can be referenced in the future. The script contains five functions for five different SVG elements: rects, circles, ellipses, polygons, and lines.
My variation of the Sainte-Victoire en Rouge is self-titled 'Clouds of Blue and Skies of White', a play on / mixing up of words. I used circles for the generation of the shapes, altering their blue hues and their radii but keeping the same general shape and format of the original.
